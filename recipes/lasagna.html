    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A 
        more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with 
        ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage 
        cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with 
        a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

    <p>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be 
        intimidated by all the layers of delicious Italian flavor â€” try 
        this homemade lasagna recipe today!</p>

    <p>This recipe will serve 8 and require 3 hours from start to finish.</p>
