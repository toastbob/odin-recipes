    <h1>Homemade Lasagna Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A 
        more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with 
        ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage 
        cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with 
        a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

    <p>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be 
        intimidated by all the layers of delicious Italian flavor — try 
        this homemade lasagna recipe today!</p>

    <p>This recipe will serve 8 and require 3 hours from start to finish.</p>

    <h2>This is how to make it</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Gather all ingredients.</p></li>
        <li><p>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.</p></li>
        <li><p>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p></li>
