    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging 
        from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family 
        favorite.</p>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake 
        recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes 
        with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your 
        kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

    <p>This recipe will serve 8 and require 30 minutes from start to finish.</p>
