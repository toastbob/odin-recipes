    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging 
        from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family 
        favorite.</p>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake 
        recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes 
        with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your 
        kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

    <p>This recipe will serve 8 and require 30 minutes from start to finish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>This is how to make it</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p></li>
    </ol>
